% Please run the respective code for the plots.
% The plots are saved seperately in the report folder
%% Part 1 - Recognition rate plots
% We observe that the recognition rate is small for smaller K values.
% It increases rapidly with K as the decomposition of the images gets more
% accurate and saturates when enough eigenvectors are used.
% The recognition rate is the same for both the implimentations.
%% Part 2 - Squared distance plots
% Recognition rate is observed to be higher when the first 3 coefficeints are ignored.
% This might be because, doing so will ignore the changes in orientation or the lighting condtions for
% the same face and hence recognize the person better.
