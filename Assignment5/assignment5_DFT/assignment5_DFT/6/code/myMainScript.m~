%% Without noise
% Coordinates seen in the matrix shift are as expected : 271,71 that is
% a shift of -30,70
translate();
%% With gaussian noise of 20 standard deviation
% Here the max value in the matrix shift was small so we clipped the max to
% 1 so that we could see the point in the image
% Coordinates seen in the matrix shift are as expected : 271,71 that is
% a shift of -30,70
translate1();
%% Time complexity:
% Time complexity of this program would be n*nlog(n*n) where n*n is the size of the image.
% If it is done directly, it would be O((n*n)^2 that is n^4
% Hence this method is much better in terms of time complexity
